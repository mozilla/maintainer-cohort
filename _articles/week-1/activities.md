#### Discussion
This week's discussion will be fairly loose, there's a bunch of reading, and a few tasks we'll cover in our call.
I'll share an agenda in advance.


### {{ site.assignment }} 

1. Introduce yourself, and goals in our Discourse (private) category!
2. Watch Katrina, Eric and Amjinth's story [Me, Myself, Maintainer](../intro).
3. Read Kris, Jess and Steve's stories [Me, Myself, Maintainer](../intro).
4. [Review Debugger's Maintainer Page](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/826490b315548b7b51ba471f43725214af55b0eb/docs/maintainer.md)including [issues](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/826490b315548b7b51ba471f43725214af55b0eb/docs/issues.md#labels). Don't worry if you have questions, that's normal!
5. Read all about [Inclusivity Bugs](../leadership), including the findings from our Contributor testing on Debugger.
6. Follow the [Debugger repo](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html), and our [cohort repo](https://github.com/maintainercohort/cohort-repo/issues) (you only need to follow activity this week).
